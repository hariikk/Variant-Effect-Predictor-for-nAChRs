In recent years, protein engineering and design have become important research areas, with many applications in the pharmaceutical, energy, and biocatalysis fields, among others─where the aim is to ultimately create a protein given desired structural and functional properties. It is often critical to model the relationship between a protein’s sequence, folded structure, and biological function to assist in such protein engineering pursuits. However, significant challenges remain in concretely mapping an amino acid sequence to specific protein properties and biological activities. Mutations may enhance or diminish molecular protein function, and the epistatic interactions between mutations result in an inherently complex mapping between genetic modifications and protein function. Therefore, estimating the quantitative effects of mutations on protein function(s) remains a grand challenge of biology, bioinformatics, and many related fields and would rapidly accelerate protein engineering tasks when successful. Such estimation is often known as variant effect prediction (VEP). However, progress has been demonstrated in recent years with the development of machine learning (ML) methods in modeling the relationship between mutations and protein function. In this Review, recent advances in variant effect prediction (VEP) are discussed as tools for protein engineering, focusing on techniques incorporating gains from the broader ML community and challenges in estimating biomolecular functional differences. Primary developments highlighted include convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and natural language embeddings for protein sequences.

  abstract = {Computational predictors of genetic variant effect have advanced rapidly in recent years. These programs provide clinical and research laboratories with a rapid and scalable method to assess the likely impacts of novel variants. However, it can be difficult to know to what extent we can trust their results. To benchmark their performance, predictors are often tested against large datasets of known pathogenic and benign variants. These benchmarking data may overlap with the data used to train some supervised predictors, which leads to data re-use or circularity, resulting in inflated performance estimates for those predictors. Furthermore, new predictors are usually found by their authors to be superior to all previous predictors, which suggests some degree of computational bias in their benchmarking. Large-scale functional assays known as deep mutational scans provide one possible solution to this problem, providing independent datasets of variant effect measurements. In this Review, we discuss some of the key advances in predictor methodology, current benchmarking strategies and how data derived from deep mutational scans can be used to overcome the issue of data circularity. We also discuss the ability of such functional assays to directly predict clinical impacts of mutations and how this might affect the future need for variant effect predictors.},

  abstract     = {Over the years, many computational methods have been created for the analysis of the impact of single amino acid substitutions resulting from single-nucleotide variants in genome coding regions. Historically, all methods have been supervised and thus limited by the inadequate sizes of experimentally curated data sets and by the lack of a standardized definition of variant effect. The emergence of unsupervised, deep learning (DL)-based methods raised an important question: Can machines learn the language of life from the unannotated protein sequence data well enough to identify significant errors in the protein “sentences”? Our analysis suggests that some unsupervised methods perform as well or better than existing supervised methods. Unsupervised methods are also faster and can, thus, be useful in large-scale variant evaluations. For all other methods, however, their performance varies by both evaluation metrics and by the type of variant effect being predicted. We also note that the evaluation of method performance is still lacking on less-studied, nonhuman proteins where unsupervised methods hold the most promise.},

  abstract      = {Summary Background Variants in genes encoding voltage-gated potassium channels are associated with a broad spectrum of neurological diseases including epilepsy, ataxia, and intellectual disability. Knowledge of the resulting functional changes, characterized as overall ion channel gain- or loss-of-function, is essential to guide clinical management including precision medicine therapies. However, for an increasing number of variants, little to no experimental data is available. New tools are needed to evaluate variant functional effects. Methods We catalogued a comprehensive dataset of 959 functional experiments across 19 voltage-gated potassium channels, leveraging data from 782 unique disease-associated and synthetic variants. We used these data to train a taxonomy-based multi-task learning support vector machine (MTL-SVM), and compared performance to several baseline methods. Findings MTL-SVM maintains channel family structure during model training, improving overall predictive performance (mean balanced accuracy 0·718 ± 0·041, AU-ROC 0·761 ± 0·063) over baseline (mean balanced accuracy 0·620 ± 0·045, AU-ROC 0·711 ± 0·022). We can obtain meaningful predictions even for channels with few known variants (KCNC1, KCNQ5). Interpretation Our model enables functional variant prediction for voltage-gated potassium channels. It may assist in tailoring current and future precision therapies for the increasing number of patients with ion channel disorders.

  abstract      = {Author summary Genetic variants can impact the function of voltage-gated ion channels, which are transmembrane channels that are important for the electrical signalling of neurons. Individuals affected by these variants may have severe neurological or cardiac disease. Knowing the functional effects of variants can help us improve the diagnosis and clinical care for these individuals, and may also enable precision medicine aimed at correcting channel function. Machine learning methods are capable of predicting these functional effects, but previous models have only included information from protein sequence and structure. Here, we have developed a novel algorithm that can integrate clinical information by using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic features encountered in human disease. These different sources of information are used to train a multi-kernel support-vector machine. Our results suggest that this model is robust, interpretable, and more accurate than previous methods. Variant functional effect prediction engines will be useful tools for clinical geneticists, neurologists and biophysicists.},
